# LED indicators using "Smart" LED

Note: this was adapted from [caksoylar's zmk-rgbled-widget](https://github.com/caksoylar/zmk-rgbled-widget) to function with Smart LEDs typically used for underglow.

This is a [ZMK module](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules) containing a simple widget that utilizes a string of Smart RGB LEDs.
It is used to indicate battery level and BLE connection status in a minimalist way.

### Battery status 

- Blink ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ on boot depending on battery level, with thresholds [set](#configuration) by `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_LEVEL_HIGH` and `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_LEVEL_LOW`
- Blink ðŸ”´ on every battery level change if below critical battery level (`CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_LEVEL_CRITICAL`)

### Connection status

- Blink ðŸ”µ for connected, ðŸŸ¡ for open (advertising), ðŸ”´ for disconnected profiles on boot after the battery blink, and following every BT profile switch (only on central side for splits)
- Blink ðŸ”µ for connected, ðŸ”´ for disconnected on peripheral side of splits

### Layer state

You can pick one of the following methods (off by default) to indicate the highest active layer:

- Enable `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_SHOW_LAYER_CHANGE` to show the highest active layer on every layer activation
  using a sequence of N cyan color blinks, where N is the zero-based index of the layer, or
- Enable `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_SHOW_LAYER_COLORS` to assign each layer its own color, which will remain on while that layer is the highest active layer

These layer indicators will only be active on the central part of a split keyboard, since peripheral parts aren't aware of the layer information.

NOTE: There is currently an unresolved issue with `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_SHOW_LAYER_COLORS` - the current widget doesn't have logic to prevent resetting RGB state to before layers were changed, so as a result, any RGB settings on layers will be overwritten.

If you need layer indicators, it's recommended to use `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_SHOW_LAYER_CHANGE` for now until this issue is fixed.

> [!TIP]
> Also see [below](#showing-status-on-demand) for keymap behaviors you can use to show the battery and connection status on demand.

## Installation

Add this module to your `config/west.yml` by adding a new entry to `remotes` and `projects`, and point your zmk source to the branch with the necessary core changes:

```yaml west.yml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: awkannan  # <-- new entry
      url-base: https://github.com/awkannan
  projects:
    - name: zmk # <-- modified entry
      remote: awkannan
      revision: develop
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: zmk-smart-rgbled-widget  # <-- new entry
      remote: awkannan
      revision: main
  self:
    path: config
```

For more information, including instructions for building locally, check out the ZMK docs on [building with modules](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules#building-with-modules).

## Showing status on demand

This module also defines keymap [behaviors](https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/behaviors) to let you show battery or connection status on demand:

```dts
#include <behaviors/rgbled_widget.dtsi>  // needed to use the behaviors

/ {
    keymap {
        ...
        some_layer {
            bindings = <
                ...
                &ind_bat  // indicate battery level
                &ind_con  // indicate connectivity status
                ...
            >;
        };
    };
};
```

When you invoke the behavior by pressing the corresponding key (or combo), it will trigger the LED color display.
This will happen on all keyboard parts for split keyboards, so make sure to flash firmware to all parts after enabling.

> [!NOTE]
> The behaviors can be used even when you use split keyboards with different controllers that don't all support the widget.
> Make sure that you use the `rgbled_adapter` shield (or enable `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET` if not using the adapter) only for the keyboard parts that support it.

| White        | `7`   |

</details>

You can add these settings to your keyboard conf file to modify the config values, e.g. in `config/hummingbird.conf`:

```ini
CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_INTERVAL_MS=250
CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_LEVEL_HIGH=50
CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_LEVEL_CRITICAL=10
```

## Adding support in custom boards/shields

To be able to use this widget, you need to define and enable RGB underglow as shown in the [ZMK Docs](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/lighting#rgb-underglow)

Finally, turn on the widget in the configuration:

```ini
CONFIG_SMART_RGBLED_WIDGET=y
```
